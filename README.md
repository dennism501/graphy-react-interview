Place Annotations anywhere!

Original brief here üëâ [Original Brief](README.original.md)

[See online here](https://graphy-react-interview.scottwarren.dev/)

### Features

* 100% test coverage üíØ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ú®
* Tested and working on modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) üëÄü¶ä
* Supports ability to place annotations anywhere on the page
* Upon creation of an annotation, a marker is placed where the user clicked to indicate the position of the annotation
* Supports ability to delete a previously placed annotation
* Supports ability to edit a previously placed annotation
* Shows/hides annotation on hover (doesn't hide when a user is editing the contents of the annotation)
* Somewhat mobile friendly
  * Tested on iOS Safari on an iPhone 7 plus
  * The markers aren't really touch friendly
  * The overall UX for mobile devices isn't great:
    * The page zooms in when editing/adding a tooltip
    * To close/escape an annotation that's in editing mode, you usually end up creating another one
* Markers in close proximity work:

With a somewhat naive approach, I have tried to address usage of markers that are close to each other with layering.

On hover, I set the z-index of the marker to a higher value than the normal marker, which makes a marker that's underneath an overlapping marker appear on top of the sibling marker.

### Limitations

* Does not handle browser resizing.
* Would like to make this more re-usable, where you would add the annotations component to a component (i.e. a graph), and then you'll be able to add annotations to that graph out of the box
* Currently there is no collision detection (i.e. if an annotation is outside of the contents of the body (or the parent container), we should display it in a different way)
* Does not handle long unbroken text very well (essentially just hides it)

### The Future/If I had more time

If given more time, or this was something I was developing for work, I would use an external library where possible (Annotations, Tooltips, etc). If using a library remains off the table, I would likely investigate solutions on the market to see what things I can learn from (including but not limited to the API usage, the style choices, the overall UX of the annotations, etc).

* I would love to get this in front of a user to confirm the UX of editing/deleting/usage.
* Handle implementations on graphs and more "real world" use cases.
* Improve how long pieces of text get handled inside the annotations
* Add rich text editing (ability to write in Markdown)
* Make the annotations component more re-usable, i.e. expansion of the Annotations API:
  * Ability to choose from a predesigned subset of Markers
  * Ability to supply a custom Marker
  * Custom callbacks for different events
* The annotations do not persist between page loads. Would like to add persistence to localstorage (so that if the API request to save the annotations fails, the user doesn't lose their annotations)
* Handle collision of bounding/parent container (i.e. the browser viewport)
* Improve the touch screen support and UX
* Think about whether using a state management library makes sense for this (i.e. Redux)
* Think about using React Hooks and Context to simplify implementation
* Seperate the management of annotations (`annotationStore`) and the rendering of annotations into an 'Annotation manager' class (for management of annotations) and functional components, to simplify the annotations.js code

### Local setup

* Clone repository
* Install dependencies: Run `yarn` or `npm install`
* Start local dev server: Run `yarn run dev` or `npm run dev`
* Visit site: Open [http://localhost:8080]()

### Testing

Run using `yarn run test` or `npm run test`.

Tests are written using Jest and React Testing Library.

### Linting

Run normal linting using `yarn run lint` or `npm run lint`

Run the ESLint automatic fix using `yarn run lint:fix` or `npm run lint:fix`

### Hooks

Tests and linting are both run on the pre-commit hook. Pass `--no-verify` to `git commit` if you want to skip these.

### Deployment

Deployed to [https://graphy-react-interview.scottwarren.dev/]() via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

To deploy:

* Run a build: `yarn run build` or `npm run build`
* Deploy:
  * To a pre-production/preview/staging environment: `npx ntl deploy`
  * To production: `npx ntl deploy --prod`

OR, just run:

Preview: `yarn run deploy`

Production: `yarn run deploy:prod`

### Data Structure

I am storing an object of the annotation objects (where the key is a unique ID), which contains the x/y of the original click, which is where I add the marker.

Using an object of annotations instead of array for ease of access, since the order of markers don't matter.

Data structure for an Annotation:

```
type Annotation {
  // X position of the marker
  x: int,
  // Y position of the marker
  y: int,
  // Whether or not the Annotation is open (this is flipped each time the marker is clicked)
  isOpen: Boolean,
  // ID: used to find the annotation when deleting/editing
  id: int,
  // Content of the Annotation. For now this is a simple string, but ideally would be rich text (i.e. Markdown)
  content: string,
  // Is the user editing the annotation note
  isEditing: Boolean,
}
```
